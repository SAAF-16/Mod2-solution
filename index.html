            <p>i need to fill this box with some random words so here's 
                the chorus of smooth criminal. <br> Annie, are you okay?
                Will you tell us that you're okay?
                There's a sound at the window
                Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
                He came into your apartment
                Left the bloodstains on the carpet
                And then you ran into the bedroom
                You were struck down
                It was your doom
